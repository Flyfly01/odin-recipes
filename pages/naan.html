            <p>Naan has always seemed like an intimifating dish to make and one that's easy to mess up. But it's actually very straight forward to make a homemade version on the stovetop in a hot skillet as opposed to a tandoor oven like in India. This recipe is made with basic pantry ingredients and can be easily elevated with some garlic and butter or other toppings of your liking.</p>

                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 teaspoon instant dry yeast</li>
                    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons yogurt</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 1/2 to 3 cups flour</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, combine yeast and warm water. Add in sugar, yogurt, egg and salt. Add in 2 cups of flour and begin to mix.</li>
                    <li>Continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until you have a soft dough that oulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead about 5 minutes by hand, or for 2-3 minutes in a stand mixer. Cover and let rise for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Separate the dough into 8 balls. Cover loosely and let the dough balls rise for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Roll out each dough ball into tear drop shapes or oabls. They should be quite thin.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large heavy skillet over medium high heat. Brush one side of the dough with melted butter. PLace butter side down int he skillet. Butter the top side. When bubbles appear, flip the dough (should only take 1-2 minutes). Cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
